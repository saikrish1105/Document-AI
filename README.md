# Document-AI
An intelligent program designed to read your documents, predict the next word as you type, and answer questions related to the document in simple terms. This tool leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the content of your documents and provide meaningful interactions.

## Features
Next-Word Prediction: Offers intelligent word suggestions based on the context of your document.
Document Understanding: Processes and analyzes your document for relevant content understanding.
Question Answering: Allows you to ask questions about your document and get concise, easy-to-understand answers.
Customizable Training: Train the model with your own dataset to adapt to specific domain requirements.
How It Works
### Tokenization:
The document text is split into smaller pieces (tokens) using the Tokenizer from Keras. Each token represents a meaningful unit, such as words.

### N-gram Sequences:
The text is transformed into sequences of tokens, which are used to train the model. N-grams capture the relationship between words, allowing the model to understand context.

### Zero Padding:
Sequences are padded to ensure they have the same length, enabling the model to process them efficiently.

### Model Training:

#### Embedding Layer: Creates dense vector representations of words based on their meaning.
#### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) used to capture long-term dependencies between words in the text.
#### Dense Layer: Predicts the next word from the entire vocabulary.
#### Next-Word Prediction:
The trained model predicts the next word based on the input sequence.

### Question Answering:
The program uses NLP techniques to extract key information from the document and provide clear answers to your questions.

## Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the predictive model.
